something i learned about people, if they do it once, they'll do it again.
do not judge my story by the chapter you walked in on.
when a woman cries, it's not usually over one thing. it's built up anger and emotions she's been holding in for too long.
i don't have time for fake friends anymore. either be real or be gone.
and a mistake repeated more than once is a decision.

i don't want to hurt you or anybody so please forget about me. just try. find yourself a better friend.
the more anger you hold towards the past in your heart, the less capable you are of loving the present.
a fake friend calls when they need something. a real friend calls to ask if you're in need of something.

i hate that i cry i'm frustrated because people think i'm hurt when i'm really just trying not to kill you.

people change for one of two reasons: they have learned a lot, or they have been hurt too many times.

when you give lots of importance to someone, you loss your own importance in their life….
tired of waking up everyday and putting on a stupid fake smile and lying to the world.

isn't it amazing how others want to blame you? for their mistakes!

some days i can handle more shit than others, today is not one of those days!
i'm so pissed off right now even the devil is saying whats her problem
if you think i'm bad now, just wait to see how i am when i actually show my feelings rather than hiding them.

i don't need anger management classes, i just need all the stupid people to go away… problem solved!
lord give me patience because if you gave me strength i'd slap a bitch
i don't need anger management, i manage my anger how i see fit at any given moment..
i am just full of anger held under by a thin line that is slowly wearing down and i don't know how much longer until i explode.
the "only" people i need in my life are the people that need me in theirs…friends come an go…true ones stay…

it's frustrating when you are so upset, and the one who upset you acts like it's not a big deal!
a good mood is like a balloon, one stupid little prick is all it takes to completely ruin it!!!
anger is one letter short of danger, take a deep breath don't let your words become danger…
hate when someone acts like your so important in their lives but once they get what they want its like you don't even exist!
don't judge me unless you have walked the life i did and understand the experience of my heart.
