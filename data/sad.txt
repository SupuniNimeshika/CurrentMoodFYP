the most painful memory is that.. when i walked away and you let me go.
my silence is just another word for my pain.
i like to listen sad song, when i'm sad to make me double sad…
people cry not because they are weak, it's because they've been strong for too long.
i feel i'm missing ,something in my life these days…
i hope you'll realize how much you're hurting me someday.
a beautiful girl with gorgeous eyes, a hidden world of hurt & lies.
in life sometimes, you have to smile to hide your fears and laugh to hide your tears…
make the most beautiful mistakes, mine is you.
i'm slowly giving up.
i know my silence and my tears will heal my pain.
the most painful moment are those which were never said and never explained….
i'm not afraid to fall in love, i'm afraid to fall for a wrong person again.
it's sad to be happy alone in life.
one of the difficult things in life is having the words in your heart that you can not speak to anyone.
i am not happy without you in life.
being ignored, worst feeling ever.
i hate missing someone and not being able to do anything about it.
but the all didn't see the little bit of sadness in me.
never put your happiness in someone else's hands.
truth hurts for a little time while, but lies hurt for a lifetime…
it's never the tear that measure the pain, sometimes its the smile we fake.
i always found the right one on wrong time.
silence is the most powerful scream.
the greatest pain that comes from love, is loving someone who are not here…
i miss how you always made time for me.
never give up on someone you cant spend a day not thinking about
sleep away the sadness of today.
loneliness doesn't kill, but sometimes i wish it did.
i want you to be free, but i can watch you soar away from me.
the cure of anything is salt water – sweat, tear, or the sea.
we can do no great things, only small things with great love.
i just want to fall asleep until i don't miss you anymore.
one of the hardest things to do.is to delete old messages which is sent by the gf.
sometimes it's better to be alone. nobody can hurt you in life!
why be mean to animals when they treat u better then people
how did i go from being so happy, to so sad…
is having one of those days where they feels like they can't do anything right.
going to keep all secrets to myself since some people i can't trust.
life's so shit it makes wot comes out the dog's ass look good!
is finally driven to the point were they finds comfort in lies and shuns the truth.
its better to be lonely then to be played by wrong people.
some nights i burn in the fire of my own thoughts
life goes on without you!
i'm used to it sometimes it's better to be alone… no one can hurt you.
sometimes i want to die for a day and just watch and see who really cares.
it actually kills me when we don't talk, it kills me when you ignore me, it kills me when you're busy with your life
sorrow is like a precious treasure, shown only to friends.
it's great when two strangers become friends, but its sad when two friends become strangers.
the part that hurts me the most, is knowing that i once had u and then lost u.
the most painful goodbye's are those which were never said and never explained….
it's sad how people become what they had promised they never will.
missing someone + no text from them = worst feeling.
i was your cure and you were my disease, i was saving you, and you were killing me.
i will never stop caring, but if you decide to push me away, i will go.
every time i start trusting someone, they show me why i shouldn't.
the worst feeling is when you smile at your crush, but they don't even acknowledge your existence.
you can never love people as much as you can miss them
depression is like a heaviness that you can't ever escape. it crushes down on you, making even the smallest things like tying your shoes or chewing on toast seem like a twenty-mile hike uphill. depression is a part of you; it's in your bones and your blood.
every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad.
being brokenhearted is like having broken ribs. on the outside it looks like nothing's wrong, but every breath hurts.
do you know the feeling, when your heart is so hurt, that you could feel the blood dripping?
just because somebody is strong enough to handle pain doesn't mean they deserve it.
the surest way to hurt yourself is to give up on love, just because it didn't work out the first time!
it hurts too much so i don't want to talk about it
it hurts to have someone in your heart that you can't have in your arms
when someone stabs you it's not your fault that you feel pain.
just because one person's problem is less traumatic than another's doesn't mean they're required to hurt less.
i have learned now that while those who speak about one's miseries usually hurt, those who keep silence hurt more...
the reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected.
it doesn't hurt to feel sad from time to time
it hurts when you realize you aren't as important to someone as you thought you were.
i didn't want to wake up. i was having a much better time asleep. and that's really sad. it was almost like a reverse nightmare, like when you wake up from a nightmare you're so relieved. i woke up into a nightmare!
every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad. do you agree with that..?
some days are just bad days, that's all. you have to experience sadness to know happiness, and i remind myself that not every day is going to be a good day, that's just the way it is!
dying seems less sad than having lived too little...
i wish i could turn back the hands of time.. back to the days when you were mine
my sadness has become an addiction when i'm not sad, i feel lost.i start to panic trying to find my way back which leads me back to my original state,..
the past cannot hurt you anymore, not unless you let it.
my silence spoke a thousand words, but you never heard them…
i've been sad for years. don't tell me it gets better.
crying allows your eyes to speak when your mouth can no longer explain how broken your heart is.
it's so hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember.
it hurts to breathe because every breath i take proves i can't live without you.
i bet you don't remember half of the things i'll never forget.
no one in this world can take away the loneliness that you gave me.
usually, people think that i'm a strong, happy person..but behind my smiles they just don't know how much i'm in pain and almost broken..
if you left me without any reason, don't come back with an excuse.
i close my eyes & dream of a time when i wasn't all alone.
i always like walking in the rain, so no one see me crying.
i overthink, overlove, overfeel and overstress
you think you want to die, but you only want to be saved!
sometimes you need to break free from any commitment, you don't bare to feel blamed, stressed, responsible for anything or anyone, it doesn't mean you are being selfish, it just signfies you have been doing that for so long and you have all the right to get tired, to have your own space and time, to lay down your head and feel you are just a floating light creature, swinging in a peaceful horizon..
silent tears hold the loudest pain
i'm not okay but i smile anyways
people always ask me whats up… i tell them nothing i'm fine. i want someone to care enough and want me to tell the truth about how i really feel. someone i want to meet. someone who would call me only to hear my voice!
sad thing is: when they say ‘forever' they mean, until they find someone better
that smile, it's fake,that laugh, it isn't real,it's only a wish,that sometime somewhere,i will find some happiness.
i don't run away i walk away slowly and it kills me to know you don't care enough to follow me.
i'll follow my brain even though it might be against my heart...
i miss you.
i miss the way you held me, the way you told me you loved me, i miss it all.
years passed ,and here i am, alone missing you!
maybe it's true we don't know what we have until we lost it, but maybe it's also true that we don't know what we're missing until we get it ...!!
the pain is there to remind me that i am still alive.
i am not alone, i am lonely with out you.
every relationship is messed up. what makes it perfect is if you still want to be there when things really suck.
sometimes it's better to be alone, no one can hurt you that way.
i miss you but i am not going to text you first, because i want to see if you miss me more.
remember, on one can make you feel, inferior without your consent.
your heart is the most precious part of you, never donate it to someone who doesn't appreciate it.
you make me feel like i'm going in spirals, i don't know what to do.
the wrong person will never give you what you want, but they'll make sure they get what they want from you.
sometimes it's easier to pretend you don't care than to admit its killing you
don't cry over someone who wouldn't cry over you.
all gracefulness, it seems, is tinged with sadness.
as a rule, our minds are sad.
isn't it sad that you are hurt so much that finally you can say i'm used to it
204 countries,805 islands,7 seas,7+ billion people and i'm single!!!
time does't really heal the heart.it just makes the heart forget all the pain.
have you ever wondered what what hurts you most…saying something that you wished had not or not saying anything and wish you had???
hate is like acid.it damages the vessel in which it is stored and destroys the vessel in which it it is poured.
if it's not a happy ending then it's not the ending at all.
my tears are like anchors that sink my heart to the depths of the deepest ocean….
it hurts when you have someone in your heart but can't have in your arms.
everybody is going to hurt you you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for.
i am not worthy of being in love…
i'm lost without love.
i don't understand the love at all..i guess it's beauty is only at the beginning..
i did everything right for someone that does everything wrong..
it sucks how some people use you when they need you and then they put you aside like you didn't even matter to them from the beginning…
love is the person you think about during the sad songs…
i was born the day you kissed me, and i died inside the night you left me. but i lived, oh how i lived while you loved me.
the only time i realized i fell in love with you was the only moment i found out that you had already belonged to someone else.
people walk away easily but they leave their memories with us forever….
no one will ever understand how much it hurts
i remember all those crazy things you said, you left them running through my head. you are always there, you are everywhere. but right now i wish you were here.
every heart has a pain. only the way of expressing it is different. fools hide it in eyes, while the brilliant hide it in their smile.
what do you do when the only one who can make you stop crying is the one who is making you cry?
i hate it when you talk to someone every single day and then it stops. all of a sudden neither of you say a word to each other
my sadness has become an addiction when i'm not sad,i feel lost.i start to panic trying to find my way back which leads me back to my original state.
i remember all those crazy things you said, you left them running through my head. you are always there, you are everywhere. but right now i wish you were here
there is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved
it's hard to wait around for something that you know might not happen but it's even harder to give up,when you know it's everything you ever wanted…
i'm here waiting for you….but you never come…..
i was born with an enormous need for affection and a terrible need to give it….
tears come from the heart and not from the brain.
once upon a time i was falling in love, but now i'm only falling apart.
but they all didn't see the little bit of sadness in me….
if you love me, let me know. if not, please gently let me go.
the hardest thing to do is watch the one u love, love somebody else.
ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.
you cant trust no one in this world anymore ..
love isn't a thing that you can play with. you will know the value of love when you get a true love and someone else play with you…
i love crying in the rain. because when i do, no one can hear the pain.
the saddest thing in the world, is loving someone who used to love you.
listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.
some say its painful to wait someone. some say its painful to forget someone. but the worst pain comes when you don't know whether to wait or forget
all i know is that i'm lost without you.
one will never appreciate love when it's still around until it gets away.
when you are in love and you get hurt, it's like a cut… it will heal, but there will always be a scar.
i hate it when crying is the only way to feel better
my heart can't love you anymore, because you have broken it.
i'm sad, because i don't know how and where i find my heart. i,m worry, because i still cannot find my heart.
one of the hardest things in life is watching the person you love, love someone else.
we always thought we'd look back on our tears and laugh, but we never thought we'd look back on our laughter and cry.
sometimes you need to take a breath, stop pointing the finger, and take a glance in the mirror.
the hardest to do is waking up without you.
sometimes you hurt the ones who love you most.sometimes you hold the one's who leave you lost.and sometimes you learn but it' s too late it's too late!!!!
never be sad for what is over,just be glad that it was once yours…
he taught me how to love, but not how to stop.
relationships are like glass. sometimes it's better to leave them broken than try to hurt yourself putting it back together
when you are in love and you get hurt, it's like a cut… it will heal, but there will always be a scar.
be careful who you fall in love with,cause someone somewhere not approve…
don't give special place to any one in your heart. its easy to give that place but it hurts more when they don't know the value of that place
you want me to act like we've never kissed, you want to forget; pretend we've never met, and i've tried and i've tried, but i haven't yet … you walk by, and i fall to pieces.
the most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting that you are special too.
i feel so stupid for still loving you
loneliness better than gathering.
almost everyone has suffered painful and sad when falling in love. that is a inevitable part when two people in love with each other.
sometimes i keep my feelings to myself because its hard for someone else to understand them ?
i tried to forget you, but the harder i tried, the more i thought about you
may it's not about the happy ending.may be it's about story…
he was the prestigious gift i have ever had …. but i was the game that he played..
breaking up is just like having the worst nightmare after having the best dream.
it's sad when you realize you aren't as important to someone as you thought you were
i'll be okay is that what you want to say..???
you are always there for me and so you give me the courage to stand alone.
cry as i may these tears won't wash you away.
breaking up doesn't mean that no more love is left; it's more of trying to save the love that's left.
tears are words the hard can't express.
love comes at first sight; injuries too.
i don't care for those, who don't care for me …
i will never come in ur life again..
it's sad to be happy alone in life..
why be upset about the people that don't want or need u in their life…?
!its better to be lonely then, to be played by bad people.
its better to be lonely then to be love by wrong girl..
i am not upset because our relationship is dying, i am upset because you aren't doing anything to save it.
smile and no one will see how broken you are inside.
i feel like a balloon… looking bright and cheerful, but empty and lonely inside.
feeling empty inside
sometimes it's better to be alone, nobody can hurt you.
loneliness doesn't kill but sometimes i wish it did.
expectation is the root of all heartache.
don't ever put your happiness in someone else's hands. they'll drop it. they'll drop it every time.
people walk away easily but they leave their memories with us forever.
this is the problem with getting attached to someone, when they leave, you just feel lost.
the worst feeling ever is when you're crying in silence because you don't want anyone to know you are.
the worst feeling isn't being lonely but being forgotten by someone you can't forget.
it's hard to move on when memories are pulling you back.
sometimes, memories are the reason why we can't move on.
sometimes we know that we cannot change the situation but we cannot make our heart understand. it keeps aching.
the worst feeling ever is not knowing whether you should wait or give up.
sometimes you just need to get away.
isn't it sad when you get hurt so much, you can finally say "i'm used to it"
i'm more broken than you think!
we all feel lost sometimes.
sometimes, it feels good to just sit alone, not talking to anyone.
nothing hurts more than being disappointed by the person you thought would never hurt you.
people will usually hurt you in attempt to heal themselves.
people will never truly understand something until it happens to them.
i've always done my best for others, while they don't even care about me.
i will always care for you, even if we're not together and even if we're far, far away from each other.
we were a perfect match but sadly matches burn.
i did everything right for someone that does everything wrong.
did i change or did you just stop loving me?
the quieter you become, the more you can hear.
brain: be patient. heart: until when?
'are you okay?' always the same question. 'i'm fine.' always the same lie.
forgive yourself for loving the wrong person.
stop setting yourself on fire for people who just stand to watch you burn.
my brain and this world don't fit each other.
my life feels like a test i didn't study for.
everything is strange. life. people.
has never hated life more, than i do at this very moment.
my heart keeps breaking.
no one understands my pain and that hurts!
it's better to be alone rather than being with someone who makes you feel like you're alone.
the heart was made to be broken.
i am thankful for all those difficult people in my life, they have shown me exactly who i do not want to be!
time heals nothing, it just makes your memories fade away.
it feels like every other part of my body is broken too.
we try to hide our feelings, but we forgot that our eyes speak.
depression is like a war. you either win or die trying.
i killed a part of me to keep you alive.
if you lose someone but find yourself, you won.
some people don't change. they just find new ways to lie.
some humans are really bad at being human.
the way sadness works is one of the strangest riddles of the world.
and someday, i hope that my sadness will be replaced by something beautiful.
two things i never want to experience again: broken heart and deep love.
you don't protect your heart by acting like you don't have one.
one of the most difficult tasks in life is removing someone from your heart.
your heart is the most powerful organ. it breaks, heals, and becomes stronger again.
dear heart, please stop getting involved in everything. your job is just to pump blood, so stick to it.
dear pillow, sorry for the tears.
my tears explain the words i fail to speak.
it's hard to answer the question "what's wrong?" when nothing is right.
the worst kind of pain is not being able to tell anyone why you feel it.
if i treated you, the way you treated me, you would hate me.
there's no point in crying, the tears won't bring you back to me.
pain is the only thing that's telling me, i'm still alive.
best way to not get your heart broken, is pretend you don't have one.
tears are how our heart speaks when our lips cannot describe how much we've been hurt.
tears are prayers too. they travel to god when we can't speak.
people cry, not because they are weak. it is because they've been strong for too long.
a tear is made of 1% water and 99% feelings.
if you could read my mind, you'd be in tears.
if you could feel what i feel, you'd be in pain.
sometimes it only takes one song to bring back a thousand memories.
if you love something, let it go. if it comes back to you, it's yours forever. if it doesn't, then it was never meant to be.
if you love someone, set them free. if they come back they're yours, if they don't they never were.
never push a loyal person to the point where they no longer care.
when you are truly comfortable with who you are, not everybody will like you. but you won't care about it one bit.
sorry is not enough. sometimes, you actually have to change.
if you're going to make me cry, at least be there to wipe away the tears.
if my absence doesn't affect your life then my presence has no meaning in it.
i feel like i'm waiting for something that isn't going to happen.
i'm not heartless, i've just learned how to use my heart less.
it's too hard to stay alone in life.
don't expect me to tell you what you did wrong. if you can't figure it out yourself, then you are not ready to correct it,cos you did not know it was a mistake.
i preferred walking away than fighting for you not because you were not worth fighting for but because you never asked me to stay…
moving forward in life isn't the hard part, it's leaving behind someone, you thought was meant to move forward with you
never cry for anyone in your life, because those you cry for don't deserve your tears and those who are deserving will never let you cry.
seven billion people on this planet and i have 2 friends
i know you won't come back but my heart will take life long time to accept this.
when you are in a habit to talk someone daily, a day without talking to them feels like a year passed
value the person when they are alive don't cry for them when they are dead.
i don't get tired of loving you. i just get tired of waiting, assuming, hearing lies, saying sorry and getting hurt.
the hardest thing to do is watch the person you love, love someone else.
it hurts when you have someone in your heart but can't have in your arms….
the more you show your true feelings, the more people find ways to hurt you.
it's amazing how someone break your heart but you still love them with all little broken pieces.
to the less fortunate… life is nothing but a tragedy
204 countries, 805 islands, 7 seas, 7+ billion people and i'm single!!!
it's sad when you realize you aren't as important to someone as you thought you were..
some battles have to be fought alone,some paths have to be crossed alone, so never be emotionally attached with anyone you never know when you have to walk alone.
keep smiling… and one day life will become tired of upsetting you
never become a daughter of a house where there's no mother
one of the biggest mistakes i've ever made was expecting my happiness from others !!
the person who once topped the inbox, now flashes in "people you may know.".!!
everybody's online, except the one i actually want too.
i take words very seriously, and it breaks my heart when i find out that people don't actually mean what they say.
that sad moment when you realize your childhood is over.
life seems to be running on a road without any shelter, without any sign board & without any destination.
sometimes your voice is the medicine to all my diseases.
the worst feeling in the world is knowing that u r no longer that important as u were.
its very eassy to say bussy when someone needs you…but…. its very hard to hear bussy when you need someone !!!
you don't realise how lonely you r until it's the end of the day and you have a bunch of things to talk about,but no one to listen !!!
no matter how hard i try, no matter how many relationships i get into…. it will never replace the one i just lost.
i remember the way u used to look at me … and now, i notice the way u ignore me…
the most painful goodbyes are the ones that never said and never explained.
never expect things to happen. its better to feel surprised,than to feel disappointed
i don't understand why i still cry for you when you don't even think about me
sometimes it't not the song that makes you emotional… it's the people and things that come to your mind when you hear it.
i hate how we went from being strangers, to friends, to close friends, to almost sumthing more, to nothing
me and she makes best couple, but her dad always create trouble
sadness is when "last seen at" changes to "online" & again to "last seen at" without reply
if distance is a solution to reduce complications… i want to maintain this distance for eternity
the good times of today, are the sad thoughts of tomorrow.
let my soul smile through my heart and my heart smile through my eyes, that i may scatter rich smiles in sad hearts.
it's sad to know i'm done. but looking back, i've got a lot of great memories.
heavy hearts, like heavy clouds in the sky, are best relieved by the letting of a little water.
i am closest to my mother, as she is my rock, my pillar of strength, and my world. not only has she stood by me through all times - happy, sad, and otherwise - but there have even been moments when i had completely lost hope, and her immense belief in me had lifted me up.
never make a decision when you are upset, sad, jealous or in love.
first, accept sadness. realize that without losing, winning isn't so great.
there is a sacredness in tears. they are not the mark of weakness, but of power. they speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. they are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.
i do believe that if you haven't learnt about sadness, you cannot appreciate happiness.
depression is the inability to construct a future
your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.
it's time to say goodbye, but i think goodbyes are sad and i'd much rather say hello. hello to a new adventure.
crying is cleansing. there's a reason for tears, happiness or sadness.
when you wake up each morning, you can choose to be happy or choose to be sad. unless some terrible catastrophe has occurred the night before, it is pretty much up to you. tomorrow morning, when the sun shines through your window, choose to make it a happy day.
everyone can have their heart broken. even if you know the relationship isn't working, it's still sad. even in a bad relationship, they're part of your life for a long time, and saying goodbye to that can be difficult.
the walls we build around us to keep sadness out also keeps out the joy.
worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy.
dying is only one thing to be sad over... living unhappily is something else.
you can never control who you fall in love with, even when you're in the most sad, confused time of your life. you don't fall in love with people because they're fun. it just happens.
it's funny how other people are willing to do lots of brave things for you.. yet.. you still choose someone who can't even offer you half of what others could
don't cry for the person who doesn't know the value of your tears…
please don't interrupt me while i'm ignoring you
missing someone hurts, but whats hurts even more, is knowing that you'r the reason that they're gone.
you get no appreciation when you are nice, but people notice when you become bad.
people think i'm bad when i'm talking, but when i'm quiet is when you really have to worry!
you will know a person's heart by the way they treat their pets.
it would be so much easier to dissapear..save everyone the trouble..
ok for those who are wondering… no! i'm not ok!.. i have not been for a while… i wont be for a long time…
what breaks my heart into pieces is knowing that you will forget the things that i will remember forever.
the worst feeling in the world is when you know that you both love each other but still you just can't be together
i may smile and i may laugh. but deep down my heart is a pain you'll never guess.
i tell people i'm ok i tell myself i'm fine, then i look in the mirror and laugh until i cry because i know it was all just a lie.
the more i do not talk to you does not make it any better it just makes my heart break even more everyday.
surrounded by many people who love me..but yet i'm so alone..why is that? is it because your the only one not there
emotionally..i am done……mentally..i am drained…..spiritually..i am dead…..and yet physically..i smile…
you can crop me out of the pictures we took together…but you can never crop me out of the memories we shared ….
one of the worst things that can happen to a person is to be forgotten by someone they will never forget.
if the relationship does not make you a better person… then you are with the wrong person.
better by far you should forget and smile than that you should remember and be sad.
its mostly the scars that people can't see that hurt the most….. they also take the longest to heal.
i wish i could escape to a place. somewhere where the feelings and thoughts won't be able to haunt me.
it took seeing what my life is like without you to know that i want you in it. i'm sorry for ever hurting you.
every time i take a step forward in my life….. i get pushed two steps back…am i walking backwards?
i smile during the day… i cry during the night…. just hoping the pain will go away.
i can hold back my tears and hide them with a smile but i can't hide that hole in my heart…
if love is the best feeling in the world, then why does my heart hurt so much?
i like to pretend that i am okay because i do not wanna annoy people with my problems.
just when you think things are going smoothly and couldn't get no better, the devil jumps in and screws everything up!
the longer i'm alone, the more i want it to stay that way..
its funny how the ones you look up to the most, can be the ones to hurt you the most!
my actions are before blinded eyes, my voice falls on deafened ears.
surrounded by many people who love me..but yet i'm so alone..why is that? is it because your the only one not there???
don`t be sad because it`s over. smile because it happened
i was your cure and you were my disease. i was saving you; and you were killing me.
there is just some days when it all seems to be wrong and nothing feels right
never let the pain from your past punish your present and paralyze your future.
everything takes me longer than i expect. it's the sad truth about life.
sad feeling is mute reminder of what is really important in our life.
the silence isn't so bad, till i look at my hands and feel sad. because the spaces between my fingers are right where yours fit perfectly.
the hardest thing is to hurt yourself for the sake of others' happiness.
it's weird how the happiest memories drive you to tears...
seeing people change isn't what hurts. what hurts is remembering who they used to be.
one day, you will wake up realizing how much i mean to you. when that day comes, i might have woken up with someone else.
the hardest part in life is trying to show the smile you know is fake and to hide the tears that won't stop.
